![Postman COVID-19 API Resources](https://psciscomeraki.lukeleigh.com/assets/images/postmanlogo.jpg)

A PowerShell Module that can be used to extract data from the NovelCOVID API (github.com/NovelCOVID/API). The API has been supplied by Postman as part of the ***"Postman COVID-19 API Resource Center"***

#### Quote

```"During the present novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, those on the front lines—including health care professionals, researchers, and government experts—need quick, easy access to real-time critical data. This type of information exchange is what APIs do best, and as an API-first company, Postman is committed to providing whatever assistance we can in this area."```

## Getting Started

### Download

You can [download](https://github.com/BanterBoy/PSCovid19Stats/archive/master.zip)
this repository.

### Import the Module

Once you've downloaded the repo place the PSCovid19Stats folder in any path in your ``$PSModulePath``. I recommend copying it to either ``C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules`` or ``C:\Users\<Username>\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules``.

Once it's in one of those paths you can either import it manually by ``Import-Module PSCovid19Stats`` or rely on auto-module loading.
