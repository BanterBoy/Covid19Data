# PSCovid19Stats
 Extracting data from the NovelCOVID API (github.com/NovelCOVID/API)

## Getting Started

### Download

You can [download](https://github.com/BanterBoy/PSCovid19Stats/archive/master.zip)
this repository.

### Import the Module

Once you've downloaded the repo place the PSSoftware folder in any path in your ``$PSModulePath``. I recommend copying it to either ``C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules`` or ``C:\Users\<Username>\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules``.

Once it's in one of those paths you can either import it manually by ``Import-Module PSCovid19Stats`` or rely on auto-module loading.
